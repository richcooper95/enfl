# enfl

This is a port of [jonculver/enfantasyleague](https://github.com/jonculver/enfantasyleague) over to Python3 and Django.

The site ([enfantasyleague.appspot.com](http://enfantasyleague.appspot.com/)) is slowly dying from Python2, and we use it
every year for a season of Fantasy Football.

Currently, this site works with user registration/signup, but not much else. The Fantasy
Football aspect is all `TODO`.

That's fine for this season (we're planning to use a different site this time around) but
this repo can be used as a basis for the next-gen EnFL at some point in the future!
